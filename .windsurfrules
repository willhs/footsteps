# Footsteps of Time - Claude Context

## Project Overview
A living atlas that lets anyone scrub through 100,000 BCE → today and watch humanity spread, cluster, and explode into cities on a single, elegant globe.

## Vision
Make the vast sweep of human presence instantly graspable by turning dry demographic tables into a visceral, time-lapse journey.

## Core Experience
1. Land on a dark globe showing faint clusters at -100k
2. Drag the slider → density blooms; cities spark on
3. Hover any dot to see name, year, population & confidence flag
4. Toggle "Show uncertainty" to reveal/hide synthetic low-confidence data

## MVP Tech Stack (v0.1)
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Deck.gl heat shader, RC-Slider control, basic tooltip
- **Backend**: Static file hosting; mbtiles served locally during dev
- **Data**: HYDE grids (every 1k yr to 1 CE, 100 yr 1-1800, 10 yr 1800-2020) + Reba cities
- **Hosting**: Vercel (static) + Cloudflare R2 for mbtiles

## Key Features
- Interactive globe + non-linear time slider (ideally 100k BCE → 2025 CE)

## Target Audience
- High-school & university educators
- History & data-viz enthusiasts
- Newsrooms needing quick historical context graphics

## Differentiators
- Full 100k year span (vs mostly last 12k years)
- Fog-of-history layer showing data gaps
- Non-linear slider scaling
- Globe + heat-map combination

## Commands
- Build: `npm run build` (if available)
- Dev: `npm run dev` (if available)
- Test: `npm test` (if available)
- Lint: `npm run lint` (if available)
